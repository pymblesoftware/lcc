This is an unoffical fork of the lcc compiler

To get this to build you need to set the BUILDDIR 
mkdir x86/osx
export BUILDDIR=$PWD/x86/osx

make HOSTFILE=etc/osx.c all


you need to have CC unset so it will pick up clang
CC=gcc will probably not work.  

To get it to work
1. put the x86/osx directory in your build path
2. sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/lib/lcc/gcc/
3. make a symbolic link with sudo ln -s path-to-x86/osx/cpp /usr/local/lib/lcc/gcc/cpp
4. make a symbolic link with sudo ln -s path-to-x86/osx/rcc /usr/local/lib/lcc/rcc
5. vi helloworld.c   write something simple
6. test the compiler trivially by running lcc -s helloworld.c and then view the assembler output with view helloword.s
 
TODO: 
Look at lburg spec for OS-X and get "make test" to work.
It is currently generating 32bit assembler, needs directives for 32bit mode or a rewrite of the backend to generate 64bit code.
Will get rid of  "error: instruction requires: Not 64-bit mode"
Pass -arch i386

Retarget to generate llvm IR
Retarget to jvm /davlik


-- original README -- 

This hierarchy is the distribution for lcc version 4.2.

lcc version 3.x is described in the book "A Retargetable C Compiler:
Design and Implementation" (Addison-Wesley, 1995, ISBN 0-8053-1670-1).
There are significant differences between 3.x and 4.x, most notably in
the intermediate code. For details, see
http://storage.webhop.net/documents/interface4.pdf.

VERSION 4.2 IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH EARLIER VERSIONS OF LCC. DO NOT
UNLOAD THIS DISTRIBUTION ON TOP OF A 3.X DISTRIBUTION.

LOG describes the changes since the last release.

CPYRIGHT describes the conditions under you can use, copy, modify, and
distribute lcc or works derived from lcc.

doc/install.html is an HTML file that gives a complete description of
the distribution and installation instructions.
